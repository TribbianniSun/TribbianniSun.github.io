Hi there! My name is Haihao, and here is an introduction about myself!

I was born in Nanjing, China. At 18, I came to San Diego, California, to complete my undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering. Afterwards, I relocated to New Haven to pursue a master's degree in computer science.

Computer Science gave me a solid foundation in both software and machine learning. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about and interested in various other fields that I hope to explore and delve deeper into, such as:

- Machine Learning/Deep Learning
- Quantitative Analysis

In my spare time, I enjoy participating in programming competitions. This allows me to write some code and express my ideas through coding. I am proud of being the first engineer in my family.

My non-technical hobbies tend to change over time. Currently, I enjoy playing the board game Dominion and go. In the past, I've enjoyed games like Splendor, Wingspan, and Fortnite!

Fun fact: On average, American people relocate _11.7_ times in their lifetime. Surprisingly, I have already moved _8_ times.
